Design:
10% of all minted coins are sent to whoever created the coin
If the previous block hash ends in a number divisible by 3, mint them a third of what they were supposed to get 
If the address mining coin holds two distinct coins other than this coin, do not allow that person to withdraw
1% of every transaction is sent to the wallet of a children's hospital, along with two other random coins bought with another 0.5% of the transaction
